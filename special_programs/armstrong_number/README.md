An Armstrong number, also known as a narcissistic number or a pluperfect digital invariant (PPDI), is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

For example:

- **153** is an Armstrong number because:
  \[
  1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
  \]
  Here, the number of digits is 3, so each digit is raised to the power of 3.

- **9474** is another Armstrong number because:
  \[
  9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 9474
  \]
  In this case, the number of digits is 4, so each digit is raised to the power of 4.

Armstrong numbers are typically defined in a specific base, usually base 10, and they are interesting in the context of number theory and recreational mathematics.

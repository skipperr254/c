# Note

This is a program to check whether a number is a palindrome or not. A palindrome number is one which when reversed is still the same. 

For example, say 1001 in reverse is still 1001 hence it is a palindrome.

Implemented using various methods:

### 1. Brute Force
This method uses mod and division to create a new number by taking the digits from the least place value.

Works but not perfectly as it does not consider trailing and leading zeros in a number, e.g., 010.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or any other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. Some examples of palindromes include:

- **Words**: "radar", "level", "madam"
- **Phrases**: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
- **Numbers**: 121, 12321

The key characteristic of a palindrome is its symmetry, meaning it looks the same from both directions.
